# Final-Project-CS-1051
# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Escape 1051

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The objective of the game is to reunite the sprite controlled by the player with another sprite at the end of the game. The player will have to get around obstacles and answer questions about the Python language. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Player will be able to control the movement of sprite using arrows on keyboard. Player will also be able to customize character. Will player is trying to navigate the maze, they will encounter questions about CS 1051 that they must answer correctly to move forward. Coding will done on RenPy, and we will upload original. Background and spites from drawings created on iPad. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not doing that

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A game that functions with the arrows on the keyboard. We will use sprites and a background that we created ourselves. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Player will be able to both navigate maze AND answer questions about CS 1051. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Player will be able to customize their sprite and the spite that they meet at the end to win the game. There will also be mini games within the game itself. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, we need to familiar ourselves with bot Github and RenPy. Next, we will need to create a sprite. We'll each create one sprite and collaborate in the background. We will then need to create a code for the movement of the sprite, and the code that will ask the player questions about CS 1051. We will each take on one of these tasks. Finally we will work together on a code that allows the player to customize the sprite.
